<h2>Abstract</h2>

This specification defines risks that can apply when operating a blockchain node.

It describes mitigations that can minimise the likelihood that particular risks will be realised and cause a problem,
such as compromising the ability to manage a node or actions that result in reduced economic rewards, or penalties such as slashing.

Finally, it provides a set of controls to verify that a Node Operator is appropriately managing the relevant risks.

</section>

## Introduction <a href="#sec-introduction" id="sec-introduction">ðŸ”—</a>

### Purpose <a href="#sec-purpose" id="sec-purpose">ðŸ”—</a>

This specification builds on the DUCK knowledge base as an evolution. In addition to the risk framework, updated based on feedback from practitioners,
and an explanation of mitigation strategies that has likewise been updated, it provides a single set of controls - statements of requirement that can be tested,
to ensure that as far as possible a Node Operator is following the recognised best practices to minimise risk and effectively maximise their returns.

While there are other standards such as AICPA's SOC 2Â® [[?SOC2]] or ISO's 27001 standard [[?ISO27001]] that can be applied to Node Operators,
they often include more general requirements than this specification, reflecting a broader scope.

The relevant controls from several such standards are explicitly linked to the controls in this specification. The purpose of this is twofold:
to simplify the process of certifying conformance to this specification for Operators who have already undergone testing against those standards,
and to simplify the process of assessing against those standards Node Operators who have been certified as conforming to this specification.

<section id="conformance">

Conformance to this specification is based on meeting the requirements expressed in the [Controls Catalog](#sec-controls-catalog).

</section>

## Risks

This specification divides risk into seven categories for Node Operators to consider in ensuring the quality of their overall setup.


### Financial and Regulatory Risk {#sec-financial-risk}

### Key Custody Risk

The risks associated with Key custody are divided in this specification according to the type of Key:

- [Validator Keys](#validator-key-custody-risk) enable the operator to manage their nodes. These risks, if realised, have a direct impact on operations, which is very likely to have a financial and reputational impact, and possibly leaving an operator unable to meet contractual obligations.
- [Withdrawal Keys](#withdrawal-key-custody-risk) enable the operator to manage their digital assets, and these risks have a direct financial impact.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

The Mitigation Strategies section serves as a go-to resource for node operators,
providing actionable insights and mitigation options to enhance the security, reliability, and efficiency of their operations.

Most of the best practices that optimize up-time, access control and general stability directly apply to operating a node properly.
However, there are a few risks that are very specific to running a node-operator, and to mitigate them,
higher levels of process segregation need to be achieved.


### Risk Management {#sec-mitigations-risk-management}

A core principle for mitigating risks is to actively identify and manage the risks.
This means understanding the particular risks, and the likelihood of something going wrong and the likely impact if that does occur.
That information enables a Node Operator to decide what level of risk is reasonable and how to prioritise available resources to mitigate risk.
Risk management decisions need to take into account any regulation that obliges a Node Operator to meet specific benchmarks or implement specific mitigation strategies
or other activities.

A first step for effective risk management is to document the potential risks, as well as the tools and processes currently in place.
Documentation needs to include an assessment of the relevant risks, what is acceptable,
and how each process or infrastructure component contributes to and protects against risks.

This enables Node Operators to identify activities that are not contributing to the business, or that actually increase the potential risks they face.
The accuracy, availability and completeness of this information is of crucial import.

Best practices include:

* Identify relevant staff and others responsible for identifying, assessing, and determining how to manage risks
* Ensure that every service, where possible, is configuration hardened using common benchmarks such as [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org).
* Analyze each component in your infrastructure environment in terms of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy.
* Outline directly which risks are a high priority, and which ones are more acceptable, and the scenarios where it applies. For example, downtime comes only with an opportunity cost for ETH stakers, but may cause a slashing event in Polkadot.

#### Assessing risks

A standard industry approach to assessing risks is to consider the probability of an event occurring and the likely impact of that event.

If these are ranked on a linear numerical scale (e.g. probability between 0 and 1), and an approximate overall financial impact, they can be multiplied,
provide a ranking for priority of mitigating each risk.

Since the cost of risk mitigation varies considerably, the overall priority for addressing risk, or deciding that a given level of risk is acceptable,
generally depends on comparing the risk ranking with the cost of mitigation, and available resources.

##### Assessing Finanacial Impact

There are a number of factors to take into account when assessing the overall financial impact of a given risk, with the direct cost incurred as the most obvious.
It is important to understand the time required to mitigate the impact of an event, and the cost that will be incurred over that time.

An incident can incur a variety of costs in terms of employee time spent managing the incident, communication, and follow-up,
new mitigations implemented to mitigate concrete or reputational damage such as replacement or additional infrastructure,
as well as potential costs of compensation or legal costs.

It is also useful to consider opportunity costs such as reputational damage, or competitors taking advantage of an incident to promote themselves as a better alternative.

##### Assessing Incident Probability

Predicting the likelihood of an unexpected future event is generally difficult, and results are unlikely to precisely match the predictions.
Nevertheless it is important to consider the context of a specific operation and attempt accurate predictions.

There are best practices to do this effectively:

* Analyzing historical data to understand past trends and incidents (external, internal incidents, and near-miss incidents)
* Reviewing industry reports for insights into common risks and their fiscal consequences in similar scenarios

### Technology Stack {#sec-mitigations-tech-stack}

In a nutshell: technology needs to serve the business goal, not the other way around.

To ensure this happens, it is important to consider both the business goals, and the available technology, and then use appropriate technology to meet those goals.

#### Local Anti-Slashing Database

To avoid double signing, validators can maintain a history of messages they signed.
This data is crucial, as inconsistencies can cause a double-signing event.
The data needs to be reliably persistent, and properly connected to the systems that use it.

<div class="info">

##### A local anti-slashing database helps address the following risks

* [SLS1](#risk-sls-1), [SLS2](#risk-sls-2), [SLS3](#risk-sls-3)
</div>

#### Signature Management

Tools that manage signatures for transactions generally provide a workflow that includes passive and active protection against a variety of risks.
Using these tools helps minimise the chances that a signature is given without checking what is being signed, and that risk-bearing transactions require
appropriate authorization.

Properly configured signature management tools also provide the ability to recover, or mitigate any problems, in the case where a transaction was not completed.

As well as the use of various kind of "<dfn>multi-sig</dfn>", which can include simple requirements for multiple signatures,
or incorporate such techniques as multi-part compute ("MPC") or the like, signature management tools can include automated verification steps in the process of authorizing a transaction.

Tools such as Web3Signer and Dirk help manage signatures securely, when properly used.

* [KEC5](#risk-kec-5), [KEC6](#risk-kec-6)
</div>

#### Client Diversity

A diverse set of clients for different protocols can reduce "blast radius" in a case where one client has a protocol error or other bug.
The most common scenario for this being realized is likely when an upgrade introduces a problem.
The ability to migrate relevant keys to a different client, if a specific client error is observed, provides an important layer of protection.
In addition, maintaining client diversity helps ensure that the network as a whole does so,
ideally providing real protection against a vulnerability present in a single version of a single client by ensuring that particular version is not able to dominate the network.

Note that there are often a different range of clients available at different levels of the infrastructe.
For example in Ethereum, it is possible to run different clients on each of the Execution and Consensus layers, and indeed best practice is to do so.

#### Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)

In order to avoid the single-point of failure problem for a node-validator without risking a slashing incident, DVT has been developed.

#### Lido-specific: Handling of Delinquent State

Node operators need to withdraw validators correctly, as they are otherwise put into a delinquent state. This results in an opportunity cost realised as monetary losses.

### Information and Secret Management <a href="#sec-mitigations-secret-management" id="sec-mitigations-secret-management">ðŸ”—</a>

Information management can mitigate many risks. One aspect is the management of highly confidential information, such as the management of signing keys or withdrawal keys, but it is also important to manage operational information.

#### Controlled and Audited Secret Access

Best practise for credential management is to use a [Single Sign on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) system,
that gives users authorised access to secrets through e.g. [certificates](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Certificate-based_Authentication),
and/or [vault mechanisms](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates).

In this way, everything is audited, and anomaly detection can be activated for those vaults.

Using [=multi-sig=] wallets requiring authorization from multiple parties for specific actions, helps to ensure both that relevant access is monitored and that it is correctly controlled.

<div class="info">

##### Secret access management helps address the following risks

* [SLS5](#risk-sls-5)
* [KEC1](#risk-kec-1), [KEC3](#risk-kec-2), [KEC2](#risk-kec-3), [KEC4](#risk-kec-4), [KEC6](#risk-kec-6), [KEC8](#risk-kec-8), [KEC9](#risk-kec-9), [KEC10](#risk-kec-10), [KEC11](#risk-kec-11)
* [GIR25](#risk-gir-25)
</div>

#### Encrypted Data

Many different components interplay while a staking operation is going on.
If confidential information is not protected by encryption, it can be intercepted and read during transmission.
There is also a risk of accidental or malicious leaking of stored information, which can be somewhat mitigated if that information is stored in encrypted form.

It is therefore crucial to ensure that confidential data is only stored and transmitted in an encrypted state.

<div class="info">

##### Data encryption helps address the following risks

</div>

#### Cold Storage

Cold Storage, in particular "air-gapped" storage, can help protect information not used often such as withdrawal keys, private key generation materials, and the like,
by making it more difficult for malicious entities to access the information and by reducing the chance that it will be leaked in the event of accidentally publishing data.

<div class="info">

##### Cold storage helps address the following risks

* [KEC5](#risk-kec-5), [KEC6](#risk-kec-6), [KEC7](#risk-kec-7)
</div>

#### Key Management

It is important to protect private keys from accidental or malicious misuse, and in particular deletion.
It is not normal to provide broad access to unencrypted signing keys.

Best practices include ensuring that there are no single individuals with the capability to access or delete them, and having backups.
Modern vault systems enable the enforcement of policies to ensure that access to keys is only available with verified roles, and deletion is managed according to established protocols.

<div class="info">

##### Key management helps address the following risks

* [KEC2](#risk-kec-2), [KEC10](#risk-kec-10), [KEC11](#risk-kec-11)
</div>

#### Key Rotation

Key rotation following a proper process help protect infrastructure from a potential misuse of credentials.

Best practise is generally "When in doubt, rotate". It is important to rotate keys whenever a data breach occurs,
but it is widely considered a good practise to require periodic key rotation to mitigate against exposure in the event that a data breach is undetected.

Keys to rotate include, but are not limited to:

* Keys used by signature management tools
* The vault itself
* Any SSH keys
* Any API keys for your cloud infrastructure

<div class="info">

##### Key rotation helps address the following risks

* [SLS8](#risk-sls-8)
* [GIR6](#risk-gir-6), [GIR7](#risk-gir-7)
</div>

#### Operational Information Management

Node operators are likely to rely on a wide range of operational information,
including internal procedures, understanding software configurations, plans for future development, and employee management.

Best practise includes ensuring there is no single point of failure due to centralized information being held by a single external provider
or only being known to a single employee.

Documentation, even if rarely actively read by those responsible for operations (who presumably know their job), is important for many reasons including
- to enable onboarding new employees and service partners, or helping employees take on new roles
- to ensure smooth continued operation in the case that a key employee's role changes, particularly where they leave the organisation
- to enable accurate reporting as necessary
- to enable monitoring of operations and investigation of security incidents and other failures

* [SPS0](#risk-sps-0)
* [RER1](#risk-rer-1), [RER3](#risk-rer-3)

#### Deletion protection

Loss of important information, especially loss of control over keys, can have a crippling impact. It is important to have mechanisms to preotect against, and recover from,
unintentional or malicious deletion of important data.

Best Practise includes having journaled backups of important information.

##### Deletion Protection helps address the following risks:

* [FIN7](#risk-fin-7)

### Access Controls and Access Management <a href="#sec-mitigations-access-management" id="sec-mitigations-access-management">ðŸ”—</a>

Access Control covers physical access to devices and facilities, the ability to connect to servers through networks,
and the ability to perform specific tasks, such as getting answers to requests.

The core principle to follow in granting authorization is [=Least Privilege=].
This is generally achieved by using some form of [=Role-Based Access Control=], in combination with an inventory of assets and services, to ensure that only those who need access are granted that access, and that it is revoked as soon as appropriate.

Tracking this information is important to ensure that access can be audited and verified.

**Examples for best practices:**

* Creation and continuous analysis of Software Bill of Materials [[?SBOM]].
* Use of Clients, roles and groups when using [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html).
* Have an internal virtual private network and only have well-defined endpoints be accessible from the web.
* Use a [Single Sign on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) mechanism.
* Disable meta-data serving through public endpoints (like what server is running in what version).
* Limit the outbound traffic of a node that runs a certain service.
* Apply rate limits to ensure that internal services cannot unintentionally DDos each other.
* Where possible apply the use of authentication tokens that have a limited lifetime.

<div class="info">

#### Access control helps address the following risks

* [DOW7](#risk-dow-7), [DOW16](#risk-dow-16)
* [GIR1](#risk-gir-1), [GIR7](#risk-gir-7), [GIR9](#risk-gir-9), [GIR22](#risk-gir-22)
* [KEC4](#risk-kec-4)
* [SPS0](#risk-sps-0)


</div>

#### Least Privilege

The core of <dfn id="def-least-privilege">Least Privilege</dfn> is that access is only granted to those who need it, and only for as long as it is relevant. This means that an individual user's privileges are likely to change over time, and in particular any offboarding process includes a rapid revocation of user's assigned roles.

Almost all Least Privilege implementation is managed through <dfn>Role-based Access Control</dfn> (commonly known as "<abbr>RBAC</abbr>"), where a set of roles are defined according to the tasks they need to perform,
and access rights are based on holding a particular role,
with individual users assigned relevant roles that are revoked or deliberately renewed on a timely basis.
It is important to ensure that individuals can fulfil their designated tasks,
without having authorizations they do not need.


**Example best practices:**

* Assignation and revocation of roles needs to be efficient and rapid
* Disable privilege escalation mechanisms ([like executing as root user inside a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_exec/), `docker exec -uroot`)
* [Impersonation mechanisms need to be audited (if it is enabled).](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/docs/documentation/server_admin/topics/users/con-user-impersonation.adoc)
* Credentials rotation needs to be in place to ensure that there is no interruption in the service when it is done.
* Off-boarding of a terminated employee does not take more than an hour. Ideally, one would only disable them inside a single-sign-on service such as [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) or [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org).
* Review of roles and permissions on a regular basis for both users and programs, to determine if these are too narrow or wide.
* Use of roles on the API endpoint level to determine the correct authorization.
* [Webserver authentication configuration of Microsoft IIS servers.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/) Observe how different authentication methods are possible to be set there. `anonymousAuthentication` would allow anyone to access as `anonymous`, which is rarely the intention except for the starting page. `basicAuthentication` is better than nothing, but makes user management not scalable. `clientCertificateMappingAuthentication` and `digestAuthentication` are the better ways to also implement RBAC.

#### Employee Authorization Management

Ensuring that employees whose roles have changed do not have lingering credentials reduces the risk they others can misuse those credentials to cause harm.

Best practices is to ensure authorization changes are automated as part of management of employee lifecycles,
covering role changes as well as termination, transfer, and promotion procedures

#### Managed Network Access to Nodes

Following the principles of defense in depth and [**least privilege**](#def-least-privilege), it is important that nodes are not directly accessible without permission, and that they do not leak information to the Web that can help malicious parties gain unauthorized access.


As well as controlling physical access where possible, it is best practice to ensure that nodes are only responsive through restricted access networks,
for example restricting web access through a VPN, and load-balancer that has a firewall,
as well as ensuring any remote access capability is clearly justified.
Further, it is important to ensure the hardware running nodes does not have extraneous software,
and does not allow generic probing mechanisms such as open port scans that can help malicious parties learn the topology of target systems.

<div class="info">

##### Managed network access helps address the following risks

* [SLS12](#risk-sls-12)
</div>

#### Authentication Policies

Best practice is to use password and related authentication policies to ensure that access control mechanisms are sufficiently strong at every layer of the infrastructure. This can include appropriate requirements for the strength of passwords and the use of Multi-Factor Authentication as well as [=Multi-Sig=] requirements.

<div class="info">

##### Authentication policy helps address the following risks

* [SLS13](#risk-sls-13)
</div>

#### Managed Physical Access

This covers all physical devices that can access the Node, as well as all areas in which such devices are kept,
whether "on-premises", distributed, hosted by a third party, or remote mobile devices such as laptops.

Best practice for managing physical access includes ensuring that authorization is only granted as necessary,
following the principles of [Least Privilege](#def-least-privilege).
Generally this means some devices are physically segregated in areas where access is restricted according to function.
Note that this covers the use of devices authorized to access the networks that nodes operate on,
and is particularly important for devices authorized to access management and analytical functions of nodes.

Ideally all physical access to premises and facilities is monitored, to deter and determine whether the facility is subject to <dfn>piggybacking</dfn>.
This term refers to the situation where an unauthorized entrant is allowed in by someone who has a valid authorization for themselves.
In the context of remote operators' access through a computer, controlling this is particularly challenging in practice.

[=Piggybacking=] can occur inadvertently through politely holding a door for someone without checking that they have current valid authorization to enter,
negligently by allowing someone to enter for a legitimate purpose despite knowing that person does not have valid authorization,
or maliciously allowing someone to enter knowing that their purpose is nefarious.

In the inadvertent case, relevant mitigations include

- ensuring that all those with authorization understand the necessity to enforce physical access control,
- providing simple and effective ways to check authorization,
- ensuring that remote access devices as far as possible are dedicated to the defined purposes
(rather than allowing the use of general-purpose laptops that could be attacked when being used for a different task such as general email, or playing games).

To minimize negligently allowed access, it is important to ensure that access systems are effectively maintained and managed to ensure there is no good reason to allow an unauthorized person access.
This can range from the design of onboarding systems to the effectiveness of internal management feedback systems for discovering unanticipated problems faced by operators.

Best practice includes managing physical access with systems that can efficiently enable access to authorised parties (keycards, biometric scanners),
and monitor actual access such as visual verification that the authorized party is the one entering.

It is important to log and audit access sufficiently frequently to detect problems - see also [Monitoring](#sec-mitigations-monitoring).

### Protection against Environmental Threats <a href="#sec-mitigations-environment" id="sec-mitigations-environment">ðŸ”—</a>

Physical devices are subject to physical changes, including environmental issues such as temperature extremes that can cause damage,
and utility failures such as power or internet failure.

Mitigation strategies include the use of redundant infrastructure with failure detection and failover systems,
from backup node servers in different geographical locations to backup power supply e.g. through local batteries or power generation.
The level of mitigation that is appropriate depends on the level of risk, and the costs of both failure and mitigating failure.
These calculations mean economies of scale will enable larger-scale operations to be more robust than smaller ones, for a given price.

It is also important to ensure that facilities have appropriate protection from relevant environmental risks such as fire, flooding, or extreme wind,
and destructive physical attacks. Appropriate mitigations will depend in part on the specific location and nature of the facility.

<div class="info">

##### Protection against environmental threats helps address the following risks

[Monitoring](#sec-mitigations-monitoring) can also identify specific conditions that adversely affect equipment and suggest that a lifecycle plan needs adjustment - whether writing off equipment destroyed by fire, or increasing preventive maintenance for physical access systems that are being used far in excess of expectations that drove the existing maintenance plan.

### Manage Equipment Life-cycle.

The lifecycle of equipment, most particularly node servers and computers used to access and manage them, is a determinant of overall security.

Best practices for lifecycle management include the ability to remotely pause, shut down, and wipe devices clean, although this needs to be considered in the context of the risk of malicious access to those capabilities.

[Monitoring](#sec-mitigations-monitoring) can also identify specific conditions that adversely affect equipment and suggest that a lifecycle plan needs adjustment - whether writing off equipment destroyed by fire, or increasing preventive maintenance for physical access systems that are being used far in excess of expectations that drove the existing maintenance plan.

#### Secure Development Life Cycle

A secure development lifecycle helps ensure that vulnerabilities are not introduced to codebases, and subsequently deployed.

Best practices include the use of auditable version control systems, with thorough testing and authorisation before changes are accepted.

<div class="info">

##### Secure development lifecycle helps address the following risks

* [GIR25](#risk-gir-25)
</div>


#### Comprehensive Testing for Changes to Code

A comprehensive test suite helps ensure changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities or situations that lead to operational failures.
Equally, it is important that someone other than the developer who produces Code changes reviews them.

Best practices is to enable this through a code repository, incorporating static and dynamic testing in the integration pipeline for code development.

Static and Dynamic analysis is important, as well as user testing wherever changes impact user interface or user-generated content.

Measuring test coverage, and requiring new tests that are reviewed as part of and code review,
help ensure that coverage is sufficiently comprehensive to detect errors that can arise through later changes.

</div>

#### Validated Inputs and Outputs

Unchecked inputs are a major cause for overflow attacks and brute force. Ideally, the load balancer in front of the node filters out all traffic that has too large headers and payloads. Additionally, if JSON payloads are being used, it is important to validate them against the relevant schema.

<div class="info">

##### Input checking helps address the following risks

<section id="sec-mitigations-manage-updates">

### Manage Software Updates

Updating software is a major risk vector. Good processes for software development and managing the deployment of updates are important to mitigate some of this risk.
As well as having control over the update process, it is important to have the capacity to revert to a known environment in an emergency where an update has been found to introduce unexpected problems.

**Examples for best practices:**

* Use [GitOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/#what-is-git-ops) for infrastructure.
* Using GIT also for infrastructure code and configurations.
* Use database migration systems such as [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org).

</div>

#### Avoid Customizing Third-party Software

Validator software, and other software validators use, is very often open source.
However, customising software can introduce errors.
In addition customizations can produce incompatibilities when software is updated.

This means that any customization introduces a need for continued extra testing,
in particular whenever relevant software is updated.
Customization also increases the risk that test coverage is inadequate,
so that a future error will not be found in pre-deployment testing and only discovered through a failure operating in production,
with attendant risks of reputational damage, direct losses, and increased cost for incident management.

<div class="info">

##### Not customising third-party software helps address the following risks

</div>

#### Configuration Management

It is important to manage the configuration of hardware, and software. A minimal profile helps reduce possible attack surface,
while minimising, and carefully tracking, customisation is important to ensure smooth and safe upgrades.

Software configuration to follow includes, among others:
  * Firewall configurations
  * Docker image setups
  * Container orchestration configurations
  * Database configurations
  * Webserver/Load balancer configurations

[CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org) provide configuration standards for many pieces of software,
while automated tools to track and scan for best practices are available such as [CoGuard](https://www.coguard.io).

#### Protection against Supply-chain Malware

Protection against malware needs to be implemented on all assets and users need to exercise proper caution.

**Examples for best practices:**

- Regularly check the latest [CVE entries.](https://cve.mitre.org), to cover all software tools used. Tools such as [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) can help with this.
- Specifically check for any announcements of vulnerabilities before upgrading any software component

#### Pre-deployment testing environments

Use separate tests and staging environments

This minimizes a potential blast radius. It is important to run any change (even an update of a validator software or Web3Signer) through a test environment first, and then roll it out in a staged fashion. If it causes some slashing event, it is then contained to the few nodes that it was rolled out to.

Human error is always a risk. An automated script, whether or not invoked by a human, can help minimise indavertent errors.

Another benefit of properly set up automation is that it can help reduce the risk of exposing secrets.

### Monitoring and Alerting <a href="#sec-mitigations-monitoring" id="sec-mitigations-monitoring">ðŸ”—</a>

Monitoring dashboards are an important tool to identify risks and gain relevant data.
This is one reason that a requirement for monitoring is present in almost all compliance and security frameworks.

It is crucial to monitor not only high level business functions but all containers.
In particular, proper log collection makes it possible to dynamically verify low-level requirements,
including

* Web3Signer database has no CRUD operations going on (is it connected?)
* CPU/Memory does not spike suddenly in a container
* Network traffic in and out of container is within expected parameters
* Relays are functioning as expected
* Slashing related logs on validator nodes are accurate and correctly checked

Likewise, there needs to be useful and targeted alerting system based on the monitoring system.
It is important to learn that a potential problem has been identified as soon as possible, and act on it.
However, a system that overloads its watchers with alerts is likely to lead to <b>alert fatigue</b>,
where the alerts are ignored in practice because too often they are not identifying a real problem.

Alert systems can in turn drive automated emergency responses, ranging from capture of increased levels of detail,
through requesting additional authorization beyond the normal requirements, to full system shutdowns.

Again, there are important trade-offs between ensuring a highly responsive system, and one that is robust in the face of real-world variability.
For example, a system that can automatically suspend [=multi-sig=] transactions unless they are authorized within a short time is not always appropriate,
because it can interfere with normal operations over a high-latency network or where a number of individuals are expected to coordinate extensively,
taking a significant amount of time, before authorizing a particular action.

### Incident Response <a href="#sec-mitigations-incident-response" id="sec-mitigations-incident-response">ðŸ”—</a>

An <dfn id="def-incident-response-plan">Incident Response Plan</dfn> documents procedures for managing security incidents and events,
as guidance for employees or incident responders who believe they have discovered, or are responding to, a security incident.
A well-documented Incident Response Plan helps employees in a high-stress situation by providing a reminder of all important actions and considerations.
To be useful, it is necessary that relevant employees know the plans exist, and how to find them.


Best practices for Incident response plans include

- Identify relevant participants in advance, with well-defined decision-making responsibilities.
  Redundancy against specific failures such as a key employee being unavailable is important.
- Clear information about how to investigate and triage incidents,
  including when to notify and involve particular participants and how to escalate issues to the most appropriate person or team.
- Define clear procedures to follow for specific sets of circumstances. Where it is possible and appropriate, automated responses and alerting triggered by
  [Monitoring](#sec-mitigations-monitoring) can help ensure rapid response.
- Data collection and distribution to enable effective response, external communication, and [=Post Mortem=] analysis
- Identify relevant Stakeholders and define communication strategies for both internal and external communications

#### Identifying and Responding to Security Incidents <a href="#sec-mitigations-response" id="sec-mitigations-response">ðŸ”—</a>

There are several ways to identify that a security incident is taking place. Best practice is to have extensive monitoring in place, to identify anomalies early,
with alerting and potentially direct reaction mechanisms. Although learning from third-party discussions is a terrible way to find out about an incident, it is still better than simply not discovering it, so monitoring channels where such discussions take place is a valuable part of an overall strategy.

**Examples for best practices:**

* There are several incident response templates available.
  - One example is [[NIST SP 800-61]](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2/final).
  - Another can be found at:
  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynZfeMh3vxZu7Juh-f34b50_3WHgejiL/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=117284374075970906179\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynZfeMh3vxZu7Juh-f34b50_3WHgejiL/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=117284374075970906179\&rtpof=true\&sd=true)

<div class="info">

##### Identifying and responding to security incidents helps address the following risks

* [RER1](#risk-rer-1)
* [RER3](#risk-rer-3)
</div>

#### Analyze Security Events and Learn from Them

This is often referred to as a "<dfn>Post Mortem</dfn>",
used to learn from the event and improve relevant Incident Response Plans.

Best practices are to determine the root cause or causes of an incident, examine how the incident was allowed to occur,
and consider what changes can be implemented to prevent or mitigate similar events from occurring.

<div class="info">

##### Analyzing security events helps address the following risks

* [DOW10](#risk-dow-10)
* [GIR6](#risk-gir-6)
* [GIR7](#risk-gir-7)
</div>

#### Disaster Recovery Plan

A <dfn>Disaster Recovery Plan</dfn> is a specialized [=Incident Response Plan=]
that gives guidance on recovering one or more information systems at an alternate facility,
in response to a major hardware or software failure including the partial or complete destruction of facilities.

Best practices include maintaining secured up-to-date copies of production environments to enable fast restoration.

<div class="info">
Sample Disaster Recovery Plan templates:

* [National Institute of Standards & Technology Template](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/34/r1/upd1/final/docs/sp800-34-rev1_cp_template_high_impact_system.docx)
* [#automation](../mitigation-and-controls-library/collection-of-tools-scripts-and-templates.md#automation "mention")

##### Disaster recovery plans help address the following risks:

* [GIR19](#risk-gir-19)

</div>

#### Incident Simulations

These are also known as "<dfn>Pre-Mortems</dfn>".

Regular simulations of implementing an Incident Response Plan ensure that relevant personnel are familiar with them and can follow them when necessary.
"Pre-Mortems" simulating or "war-gaming" a specific failure also
tests that those procedures are tested to give some idea of whether they are appropriate and adequate,
and often motivates people to think about other risks, and whether appropriate procedures and mitigations are in place.

There are many possible approaches to an incident simulation, and may eventualities that they can cover. As well as a highly detailed scenario, example topics could include variations on themes such as

* Unauthorized users gain access to the servers and set about making mischief
* A complex security compromise, where details are not immediately available
* A specific scenario (environmental disaster, utility failure, operational error) results in downtime


Articles such as [[[?PREMORTEM]]]
offer further information on how to plan and implement simulations, and how to derive the maximum benefit from them.

#### Incident Communication

As well as direct financial losses, security incidents can also result in substantial reputational damage.
Appropriate <dfn>Incident Communication</dfn> with stakeholders about security incidents, both during and after the relevant incident, can significantly mitigate this risk.

It is important to note that inappropriate communication during an incident can increase the damage.
External communication has to balance stakeholders' need for information that enables them to respond in a well-informed manner
against the importance of providing clear information with as much certainty as feasible that it will not later be contradicted.

Best practice for external communication about an incident includes providing a detailed post-incident summary.

#### Relevant external controls for managed software updates

* [[?SOC2]] CC 8.1
* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.32

#### Develop Software as Secure by Design

<a href="#req-secure-development">ðŸ”—</a> <b id="req-secure-development">Code development MUST follow secure development processes to avoid introducing security risks</b>

This is a broad area. A few specific controls are included in this specification, but this requirement is intended to ensure a general production philosophy.

##### Relevant external controls for secure development
* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.25

#### Verify Outsourced Development


<a href="#req-review-3rdparty-code">ðŸ”—</a> <b id="req-review-3rdparty-code">Node Operators MUST review custom-developed code provided by third parties</b>

Best practice is to perform both internal and independent external audit, and to ensure the identity of the coders is known.
Likewise, in best practice third-party code developers are only given access to code they need to do their work, are held to high standards of confidentiality,
and work with a well-defined set of expectations

##### Relevant external controls for verifying outsourced development

* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.30
* [[?SOC2]] CC 8.1
* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.32

This covers all changes to code, including when it is necessary to roll back an upgrade.

#### Check Third-party Code for Vulnerabilities before Updating

<a href="#req-check-vulnerabilities">ðŸ”—</a> <b id="req-check-vulnerabilities">Updates to third-party software MUST be checked for vulnerabilities before deployment</b>

This covers verifying that all software updates, including validators and other nodes, have been audited to ensure they are not introducing known or new vulnerabilities.

##### External controls for checking third-party software

* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.7
* [[?ISO27001]] Annex A 8.30

<a href="#req-protect-vs-ssrf">ðŸ”—</a> <b id="req-protect-vs-ssrf">Components SHOULD use [[[CORS]]] and [[[CSP]]] to protect against Server Side Request Forgery</b>

These requirements ensure that data passed between software components can be handled safely by the receiving component. It includes data entered manually by users.

Best practice includes using JSON [schema](https://json-schema.org) and [schema evolution techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution),
and defined minimum and maximum input sizes and MIME types ([Microsoft IIS example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/staticcontent/mimemap)).

## Communications Strategy

There are two core parts to a Nore Operator's communication strategy:
Normal Operational Communication provides information about ongoing operations, to ensure coinfidence in and transparency of everyday operations.
[=Incident Communication=] is the collection of communications processes that occur when an exceptional security incident occurs that could adversely affect the normal operations, or the users of a system.

Both rely on understanding the Stakeholders, and developing approriate communication channels and procedures to ensure those stakeholders have timely access to relevant information.

### Stakeholder Overview

Some key stakeholders are <dfn>Known Stakeholders</dfn>, who have an identity known to the Node Operator
that includes at least one direct communications cannel such as messaging, email, or telephone. These typically include

* High stake investors - with whom the Operator could have contractual obligations
* Service Partners, who might be involved in operating and managing protocols and requiring governance votes, or hosting, managing or operating infrastructure as part of the node operation setup
* Media channels, platforms, and accounts covering technical and non-technical news and reports
* Other Node Operators running validators on the same network
* Staff such as those developing and maintaining critical node operations software
* Individuals or organizations using additional service provided by Node Operators (e.g., API users, customers for white-label solutions etc.)
* Corporate Regulators - who can require that Node Operators provide them with specific information, but do not necessarily communnicate with Node Operators on an individual basis

Node operators will almost certainly also have <dfn>Anonymous Stakeholders</dfn>, who might follow a Node Operator's public information channels,
or operate independently, but who do not provide individual communication information to Operators.

These can include

* Low stake investors and potential investors
* Communities involved in the ecosystem for motives as diverse as lobbying regulators, developing technical standards,

As well as many of the types of Stakeholder who also become Known Stakeholders, such as High stake investors, Media and  Other Node Operators.

### Communication Channels

Stakeholders' preferences for communication channels differ.
Where possible for [=Known Stakeholders=] it is good practice to identify them, and their individual channel preferences in advance.
However it is also important to note that a number of jurisdictions (such as the EU, with the [[?GDPR]]) regulate the use of information about individuals
that includes communication channel information.
It is important to include channels that enable [=Anonymous Stakeholders=] to follow important developments.

Broadly, communication channels can be considered two-way, enabling communication with an individual Known Stakeholder or with all of them at once,
or broadcast, enabling [=Anonymous Stakeholders=] to receive important information.
Additionally, some mechanisms allow for persistent information, while others are only temporary;
A website can be maintained long-term or the information can be removed, information sent by email can easily be retained by the recipient in perpetuity,
while information in e.g. a Slack or Telegram channel could be deleted after a matter of days or weeks

It is also important, especially for services used for two-way communication with [=Known Stakeholders=], to consider the security and privacy of the channels used.
While channels such as Telegram or Whatsapp use encryption, in the case of the former all communication is decoded at some unknnown centralized point, in the latter large amounts of metadata are available to the service provider.

While many messaging services can behave in either manner, some such as websites are well-suited to broadcast communication
while others are specifically suited to individual two-way communication.

Common communication tools that Stakeholders are likely to find familiar and actively use include Websites, email, message-based services such as Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, Whatsapp and "post"-oriented services such as X (the former Twitter), BlueSky, Facebook/Instagram, and the like.



### Stakeholder Management

#### General Procedures

The following procedures enable appropriate consideration and management of relevant stakeholders:

1. Define all stakeholders that are relevant to your organization
2. Define and align communciation channels that you intend to use for engagement with your stakeholders
3. Perform a stakeholder mapping and define your individual ways of engagement with the different stakeholder groups
4. Document all defined stakeholders with the respective management measures in the stakeholder register. Also take best practices covering incident communication into account.
5. Define appropriate intervals to review accuracy and relevance of documented contents in the stakeholder register

#### Stakeholder Map

The [Stakeholder Map](https://duck-initiative.gitbook.io/d.u.c.k.-knowledge-base/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3935398949-files.gitbook.io%2F~%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FxTRnDyIanlwU7cCKcAju%252Fuploads%252Fhdg4kca5vuEMKsr01CxP%252FStakeholder_Map_Template.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dc83db7a4-f0ed-464f-ab69-630ba1450597&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7ea4928c&sv=2) can help categorize individual stakeholders into different communication groups. It can be used as an initial assessment for further review and adaption to your individual stakeholder landscape. Review each stakeholder individually, to assess the appropriate communication plans.

##### Manage Closely

* Use direct communication channels (e.g., Telegram, Slack or similar)
* Individual status reporting and communications
* Perform immediate alignment in case of incidents

##### Keep Satisfied

* Establish public communication channels (e.g., Telegram, Discord, X)
* Regular status reporting and engagement
* Provide summary and updates in case of incidents

##### Keep Informed

* Communication channels depend on need for responsiveness (e.g., Mail, Discord, Telegram, Slack, X)
* Provide summary and updates in case of incidents

##### Monitor

* Monitor activities and react to activities and requests

#### Stakeholder Register

A stakeholder register listing all stakeholders with details about their roles, interests, and impact on the organization
is helpful for managing stakeholders, and effective communication with them.
This can be as simple as a [Stakeholder Register Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovBZbYhR5c-l83F4KKgNKam8igAKPASS/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=117284374075970906179\&rtpof=true\&sd=true),
or a more advanced CRM system, depending on the needs of the Node Operator.

## Status and Feedback

This document is an Editor's draft, for a proposed revision to the [DUCK Knowledge Base (version 1)](https://duck-initiative.gitbook.io/d.u.c.k.-knowledge-base).

Feedback is welcome, and is preferred as Issues, Pull requests and comments in this Github Repository. Please note the [Conditions of Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### History and Future

The original content of this specification was developed as the D.U.C.K Knowledge Base, and the current work is a direct evolution of that content.

In updating it, there are several changes being made. The key change is to move from a general explanation of risks and good practices
to a specification that is well-suited to assessment of conformance.

Several somewhat cosmetic-seeming changes have been made. Most obviously, the name has been changed to ValOS - the Validator Operator Standard -
and instead of a multi-page website it is available primarily as a single-page specification, in particular enabling easier use offline.

The update process aims to meet some general goals:

- Simplify redundancy
- Use linking more effectively
- Respond to feedback from real-world use, to improve the utility of the specification
- Increase the transparency of and community participation in the maintenance of the specification

### Versions and Version Numbers

The approach to versions for this specification is to maintain a publicly visible "latest Editor's draft",
representing the current state of what has been proposed and agreed as updates for a new version, and release versions, numbered 1, 2, 3 etc.

The "Editor's Draft" version may change frequently, for example weekly.
It is primarily to serve the needs of the community involved or interested in the process of updating the specification.
Part of that community is practitioners such as Node Operators themselves, developers and service providers, and assessors,
who want to understand changes that they will need to make to their workflows in the short- to medium-term future.

We seek to provide transparency into proposed changes,
and the process by which they are agreed or rejected, as well as the history of changes that have been made.

The release versions are intended to provide stable reference points, primarily for clarity in understanding the meaning of a specific assessment against a specific version.

The timing of new release versions seeks to balance keeping up with current best practice, and providing a stable target for learning and implementing.
It is likely that a release cycle will be on the order of 6 to 18 months. The motivation for a new release can be the time elapsed since the last version,
a major change to best practices or risks, or a combination of these factors, among others.
